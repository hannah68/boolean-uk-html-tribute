          <p>
            the first woman and first Iranian to win the
            <a href="#awards">Fields Medal</a> , often described as the rough
            equivalent of a <strong>Nobel prize for mathematicians</strong>,
            died of metastatic breast cancer on July 2014 at the age of 40. She
            had been a professor at Stanford University since 2008.

          <p>
            Mirzakhani has made several contributions to the theory of moduli
            spaces of Riemann surfaces. In her early work, Mirzakhani discovered
            a formula expressing the volume of a moduli space with a given genus
            as a polynomial in the number of boundary components. This led her
            to obtain a new proof for the formula discovered by Edward Witten
            and Maxim Kontsevich on the intersection numbers of tautology
            classes on moduli space, as well as an asymptotic formula for the
            growth of the number of simple closed geodesics on a compact
            hyperbolic surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her subsequent work has focused on Teichmüller dynamics of moduli
            space. In particular, she was able to prove the long-standing
            conjecture that William Thurston's earthquake flow on Teichmüller
            space is ergodic. Mirzakhani was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014
            for "her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of
            Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces”. The award was made in
            Seoul at the International Congress of Mathematicians on 13.<a
